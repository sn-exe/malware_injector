# Malware Injector

## Description

The Malware Injector is a Python script that allows you to combine a malicious binary (e.g. a malware payload) with a legitimate binary (e.g. a common application) to create a hybrid executable. This technique, known as "binary fusion" or "malware injection", can be used in various cybersecurity scenarios, such as:

- Penetration testing and red teaming activities
- Malware analysis and reverse engineering
- Developing proof-of-concept exploits

The script uses PyInstaller to package the combined binary into a single, standalone executable that can be distributed and executed on target systems.

**Warning**: This tool is intended for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Do not use it to create or distribute malware without proper permissions and approvals.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sn-exe/malware_injector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd malware-injector
   ```
3. Run the script with the paths to the malicious and legitimate binaries as arguments:
   ```
   python3 injector.py /path/to/malicious_binary /path/to/legitimate_binary
   ```
4. The combined executable will be generated in the current directory and named `<legitimate_binary_name>-injected`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyInstaller
